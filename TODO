Definition clusters don't seem to be hierarchical
Lemma clusters are empty
Proof clusters are empty

"Must be running in a script buffer!"
 - Term tree of lemma statement
 - Show similar theorems
 - Show clusters

Show clusters definitions seems to work!!! W0000000t!

Our hypotheses extraction's not perfect. Sometimes getting a hypothesis line "forall (a : bool),"

Sane proof movement:
 - Get rid of "undo" in favour of "save-proof-point"
