Integrate code improvements from 'refactored' branch.
 - NOTE: That branch is buggy WRT extracting features/generating graphs, so make sure critical behaviour is being tested!

Tests have been imported wholesale from the 'refactored' branch. Many are failing, many aren't needed.

Some FIXMEs in unit-tests.el:

 - "Show Cluster Libraries" and "Show Similar Theorems" don't seem to work for Coq mode.
 - "Similarity graph of proofs" says temp.map doesn't exist.

'ml4pg-top-level-graph-of-lemmas' often runs out of stack space (eg. it works when it's the only test being run, but fails during a run of all tests)

"Fact" should be treated like "Theorem"/"Lemma"/etc. (see 'refactored' branch)

We often run out of stack, probably due to export-theorem-aux. Short-term fix is to do:

  (setq max-specpdl-size    10000)  ;; Default is 600
  (setq max-lisp-eval-depth 10000)  ;; Default is 500

Subgoal focussing, eg. with "{...}" and "2:auto" don't work.

The keywords "Scheme" and "Context" also cause the feature extraction to
stop.

Speed! Tom Gransden's been waiting up to a day to process a proof!
